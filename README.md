# My progress on becoming a web developer

<br/>

I have made this site to show my friends and family my progress in learning full stack web development. At first I planned to make a portfolio page but later decided against it because I think the portfolio will be more useful when I have more information to present on the page.

## UX

<br/>

### User Story

<br/>

As a friend of Tommy I want to see his progress as a student to become a full stack web developer. I think that showing me some of his projects is a good way of doing this.
I would also like to see graphics in the form of progress bars so that I can see his progress in different parts of the course. It would be useful if he could write something about himself. I would also like there to be a contact page in case I want to recommend people I know to collaborate with Tommy. The design of the site should be focused on background images with a transparent navbar and footer.

<br/>

## Features

<br/>

* **Index** a short description of the site with a few pictures of Hamburg and Gothenburg to make it look nice.

* **About** This is a short about text in English, German and Swedish to make an introduction to people that might not know me. It will also have the country flags over each language.

* **Progress** Progress bars for each individual part of the course I am taking at the Code Institute

* **Projects** I am using this page to introduce some projects that I am interested in at the moment but when my own projects are done I will add them here.

* **Connect** This page I made in case some of my friends or family want to recommend people to collaborate with me, or maybe hire me.

## Technologies Used

<br/>

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

* [Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework))

<br/>

## Testing

<br/>

During my testing process I ran all my code through 1online html and css testing tools to make sure there were no errors in my code. I also ran the code through an online formatter to make sure that my formatting was correct.

<br/>

At the last part of my testing I manually went through all my code to see if I could spot any errors or spelling mistakes, I also checked every link and tested the forms so they worked as expected.

## Acknowledgements

<br/>

I got some inspiration on how to make this site from previous projects at the Code Institute, as example the Love Runnings Project. I used stack overflow and the bootstrap documentation when I needed to find out how to do some things as well.
