# My progress on becoming a web developer

<br/>

The goal with this site to show my friends and family my progress in learning full stack web development. At first I planned to make a portfolio page but later decided against it because I think the portfolio will be more useful when I have more information to present and greater knowlage when it comes to for example javascript.

<br/>

## UX

<br/>

## User Stories

<br/>

- Find information about the site owner.
- Find information about the site owners progress as a student at the code institute.
- Images of Hamburg and Gothenburg (where the site owner lives and where he is from).
- Contact the site owner.

<br/>

### User Goals

<br/>

As a user, I want

<br/>

- a website with a transparent navbar and footer that is focused on beautiful images.
- to find information about the site owners progress on becoming a full stack web developer.
- there to be a contact form in case I want to recommend someone to collaborate with the site owner, or maybe even hire the site owner.
- to see graphs on each stage the site owner is taking to reach his goal to become a full stack web developer.

<br/>

### Site Owner Goals

<br/>

As a site owner, I want

<br/>

- to showcase my progress as a student to my friends and family.
- to show the progress of each part of the course I am taking at the Code Institute.
- the site to be a channel to present my projects and progress.
- the site to be useful if my network wants to recommend people interested in collaboration to get in touch with me.

<br/>
<br/>

## User Requirements and Expectations

<br/>

### Requirements

<br/>

## Features

<br/>

- **Index** a short description of the site with a few pictures of Hamburg and Gothenburg to make it look nice.

- **About** This is a short about text in English, German and Swedish to make an introduction to people that might not know me. It will also have the country flags over each language.

- **Progress** Progress bars for each individual part of the course I am taking at the Code Institute

- **Projects** I am using this page to introduce some projects that I am interested in at the moment but when my own projects are completed I will add them here.

- **Connect** I have made this site in case some of my friends or family wants to recommend people to collaborate with me, or maybe hire me.

## Testing

<br/>

#### I first ran my css file trough a [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) without finding any errors.

<br/>

#### I then ran my html files trough a [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and I found a few errors that now is taken care of.

<br/>

- The index page was missing a heading, something I resolved by changing a paragraph to a heading.

- The index page also had a spelling error in the carouselControls which is now corrected.

- There was also a spelling error in the navbar that I now have corrected. The error is from when I copied the text.

<br/>

### Responsiveness

<br/>

- I tested the responsiveness of every page throughout the process of building the site.

- I looked at my site in different sizes using google dev tools to see how the site would look and respond in each one.

- After advice from my mentor Reuben Ferrante I changed the layout of my project cards to make them look better in tablet view.

<br/>

### Contact form

<br/>

- I tested the contact form to make sure that the form validation worked as expected on each field by typing in data.

<br/>

### Design

<br/>

- My design choice of having a transparent footer and navbar presented a problem with the body content overlapping the footer. I solved this by adding a background colour to my footer after advise from my mentor.

<br/>

## Deployment

<br/>

### I created this site with vscode and with git I pushed it to github where I also published the site.

<br/>

I made the following steps in deploying my site:

- Pushed my commits from git to github.

- Logged in to my github account.

- Selected my repositories.

- Navigated to milestone-project1.

- Clicked on settings.

- Scrolled down to where I can do the github pages settings.

- Selected the master branch from the dropdown menu.

- Clicked on save.
