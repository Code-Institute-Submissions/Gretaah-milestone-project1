# My progress on becoming a web developer

<br/>

I have made this site to show my friends and family my progress in learning full stack web development. At first I planned to make a portfolio page but later decided against it because I think the portfolio will be more useful when I have more information to present on the page.

<br/>

## UX

<br/>

### User Goals

<br/>

- Find information about the site owner.
- Find information about the site owners progress as a student at the code institute.
- Images of Hamburg and Gothenburg (where the site owner lives and where he is from).
- Contact the site owner .

<br/>

### User Stories

<br/>

- As a user, I want a website with a transparent navbar and footer that is focused on beautiful images.
- As a user, I want to find information about the site owners progress on becoming a full stack web developer.
- As a user, I want there to be a contact form in case I want to recomend someone to collaborate with the site owner, or maybe even hire the site owner.
- As I user, I want to see graphs on each stage the site owner is taking to reach his goal to become a full stack web developer.

<br/>

### Site Owner Goals

<br/>

As a site owner, I want to showcase my progress as a student to my friends and family.
As a site owner, I want to show the progress of each part of the course I'm taking at the code institute.
As a site owner, I want to show off my projects.
As a site owner, I want there to be a way for people to contact me in case a friend or family member recommends anyone to collaborate with me.

## User Requirements and Expectations

<br/>

## Features

<br/>

- **Index** a short description of the site with a few pictures of Hamburg and Gothenburg to make it look nice.

- **About** This is a short about text in English, German and Swedish to make an introduction to people that might not know me. It will also have the country flags over each language.

- **Progress** Progress bars for each individual part of the course I am taking at the Code Institute

- **Projects** I am using this page to introduce some projects that I am interested in at the moment but when my own projects are done I will add them here.

## Testing

<br/>

### I first ran my css file trough a [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) without getting any errors.

<br/>

### I then ran my html files trough a [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and I got a few errors that I fixed.

<br/>

- Index page was missing a heading and I fixed this by changing a paragraph to a heading.

- Index page also had a spelling error in the carouselControls that I fixed.

- My navbar also had a spelling error that came from when I copied it and I fixed that as well.

<br/>

### Responsiveness

<br/>

- I tested the responsiveness of every page throughout the process of building the site.

- I looked at my site in different sizes using google dev tools to see how the site would look and respond in each one.

- From advice from my mentor Reuben Ferrante I changed the layout of my project cards to make them look better in tablet view.

<br/>

### Contact form

<br/>

- I tested so that the form validation worked on each field by typing in data to see so it worked as expected.

<br/>

### Design

<br/>

- My design choise of having a transparent footer and navbar presented a problem with the body content overlapping the footer so I added a background color to my footer after my mentor adviced me to do so.
